									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/heads/Tuny_.png" alt="" /></span>back in the days when minecraft was but startting my friend told me about this game. i would go round to his house and play the game, we would do build contests and then i asked if i could borrow his account till i baught one. but then he decided to stop and i got left the account. I started with small builds and as minecraft grew i went towards the creative side of it, leaving the redstone way behind. Survival always drew me in every couple months. Minecraft always inspires creativity and has gained me many friends over the years. Its taken years of my time and i dont regret it. The comunity of minecraft is always amazing and makes people strong. It also inspires people to be creative. It gave me the insperation to choose my job for the future</p>
